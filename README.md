# ![UMI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z-eos/umi/master/doc/umi-logo.png) Unified Management Interface

**UMI** is intended to be rather flexible, though still "high level" (for use by not qualified personell), **LDAP stored data**, "simple" and "unqualified" coadmin "user-friendly" UI.

to imagine what it planned to be, have a look at screenshots  (one of the variants on the day screenshot was taken at) in [doc](https://github.com/z-eos/umi/tree/master/doc), please
